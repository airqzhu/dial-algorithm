# dial-algorithm
Dial algorithm is a nonequilibrium stochastic assignment method, which assumes that the alternatives to be choosen by passengers is link rather than paths. Therefore, it is unnecessary to enumerate all paths for each OD pair.<br> 
<br> 
It is worth noting that logit model is equivalent to Dial algorithm when all the paths can be enumerated. However, it is a challenge to enumerate all effective paths in a large-scale real-world urban road network.<br>
